Addition problems:Because I am working solely, I haven't met merge conflicts. However, I know how to solve merge conflicts. The basci step is to remove those additioanl information like "Head>>>>>" and to choose the part of code I want to keep.

Steps for running the game
The final version of game has been merged into the main branch
If you want to directly run the game, just use ./a.out command in your terminal

Note: The game will asks your for inputs. This game does not have good input checking mechanism. So

The first input will be the row location you want to play.

The second input will be the column location you want to play.

Please do not type two integers at once. It will cause segmentation fault .
